**Printing**  
3 walls, 30% infill minimum; More walls for stiffer clamp  
(Must print with 0.2mm layer height for built-in support assists to work)  
Minimal supports around the hinge and handle attachment points, but for cleaner threads you can use support there, too  
I chose not to support threads and worked fine on Ender3 v1 w/ PETG  
The screw and screw topper do not need support  

**Assembly**  
(Optional, but highly recommended) Attach 3 furniture gripping pads to the underside of the Tabletop Mount and 1 gripping pad to Screw Topper.  
Thread Screw through the Tabletop Mount and then snap Screw Topper into place

**Addons**  
M4,M6,M4 holes with 15mm spacing on center to support addons  
Currently no add-ons have been created
